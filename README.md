# CLIPIFY: A Video Summarization Tool Utilizing AI
- CLIPIFY represents a pioneering advancement in video summarization technology, leveraging artificial intelligence to condense lengthy videos into concise summaries. Unlike conventional methods that summarize videos into textual or image-based formats, CLIPIFY uniquely retains the essence of the original medium by transforming videos directly into shorter video segments.

- This project marks a significant milestone as the first deployed application specializing in video-to-video summarization. Developed as a grade project, CLIPIFY showcases innovative approaches in leveraging AI for enhancing accessibility and usability in multimedia content consumption.
